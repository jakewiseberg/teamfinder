          <h1>About the Team</h1>
          <p>Team Finder was founded, ironically, in hackMHS's team-making session, after one of its members proposed this website's core idea. 24 hours later, we've produced something far beyond all our expectations, and we've learned many, many new things.</p>

          <div class = "panel-body">
            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>Our inspiration for this project came from the very event which literally binded the team together: hackMHS's team-bonding event. The team came to a consensus that there was no efficient system of hooking hackers up with each other. We believed that this was especially problematic for new programmers, who, daunted by the giants around them, might feel ostracized and left out (and hence may not come) due to their lack of experience and difficulties in easily finding teams.</p>
            <p>Hence, we came up with the idea to get teams together. Initially we thought of our project as a team <em>generator</em>, but midway we realized that was the wrong approach- to best foster a free open space for novice hackers, it's best to simply introduce them to others like them, and leave them free to disperse. Thus, our final product began to coalesce, and we came up with <b>HackUnity</b>, a streamlined service that pairs prospective hackers with fellow prospective hackers of similar interests, to facilitate team-making.</p>
            <h3>How It Works</h3>
            <p>Basically the website functions by having users fill out a questionnaire, and then using algoritihims to compare results and pair people together. Results were stored into databases, which were then compared. This questionnaire composed of questions that hackers would typically ask each other if they were meeting for the first time. We also created an option to retain and change the results of your survey by way of an account system which, also, retains data in databases.</p>

          <div class = "panel-body">
            <h3>Reflections</h3>
            <p>Upon reflection of the progress we made throughout the project, we reflected and noted  few things that we could've done differently. For instance, we could've done more research on the compatibiltiy of Typeform's API for instance, which didn't score high at all. In addition, some research should've done to determine the impact using an API such as Bootstrap would have on other programs within the website. One other thing we should've also considered is if the domain coupons actually worked; one teammember noted how they didn't work back at hackBCA III. While these issues weren't as prevalent in hackMHS II, we should've taken a precautionary measure to ensure that problem wouldn't come up again.</p>
            <h3>Problems</h3>
            <h4>Javascript</h4>
            <p>Throughout the test, we found quite a number of problems throughout the project. The most prevalent problems were with Javascript, specifically the Typeform bug. For some reason, the Typeform API was wired so that only computers with the <em>same domain</em> as the host computer would be able to accept any recieving data. Additionally, any attempts to circumvent this issue would mean writing a highly complex Java program way beyond our skillset.</p>
            <p>We generally encountered lots of miniature bugs, and, in many painful instances, learned just how bad typos can be in programming. We also learned that hard-coding isn't generally the answer to problems.</p>
            <h4>Github</h4>
            <p>We also encountered a number of significant problems with Github, many of which were quite simple yet completely interfered with the project. For instance, attempts to use Git Shell were temporrarily disrupted after problems were found with the directory used (it was subsequently found that the command "cd <directory>" would fix this problem.).</p>
            <p>We also learned the painful lesson of committing early, and on branches <em>not</em> the master branch. Many times we hit nasty merge conflicts where we would have to go <b>line by line</b> and fix the problem There were a few times where Github simply stopped cooperating, notably when it <em>denied</em> us access to our files. To be honest, we're still not sure as to how we got out of <em>that</em> problem.</p>
            <h4>Bootstrap</h4>
            <p>Bootstrap was also substantially problematic in a number of areas. The most annoying problem was that it depended on 3 script links which <b>had</b> to be in the code. One team-member, Brian, neglected to copy all 3 (he only copied one), so he spent a good hour tearing his hair out over this problem, only to find the simple fix which had eluded him.</p>
            <h3>Future Plans</h3>
            <p>Assuming we had more time, we would expand on the project, enough so that MLH could integrate this website into their own website. This would ensure hackers accross the country would be able to connect even more with fellow hackers, and learn even more.</p>

            <h3>Github</h3>
            <p>At the core of this project was Github, a version control system widely used amongst hackers and professional developers all around the country. While we all had some experiences with Github, we became intimately involved with using Github (for lack of a better term) for the first time, whether it be with Sourcetree, Github Desktop, or Git Shell (really it's Git Bash but k). In terms of the learning expereince, Github was undeniably the biggest thing we all learned about today.</p>
            <h3>HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap</h3>
            <p>Obviously, HTML and CSS were core elements of this website, but what was unique about this website for all of us was that it was the first time we used <b>Bootstrap</b>, an API for HTML. Its capabilities exceeded all our imaginations, and gave us plenty new opportunities to modernize our website and exponentially increase our potential.</p>
            <p>While the hardest part about Bootstrap was learning its unique system of classes and its unique structure, the benefit we got back, in terms of the website's appearance and the knowledge we gained, was ten-fold.</p>
            <h3>PHP & SQL</h3>
            <p>PHP and SQL were used to handle the really back-ended aspects of the project. They handled all the raw numbers that we had to process from our form (more about that on this page), and overall kept the page up and running. PHP and SQL were undeniably the <em>hardest</em> portion of this project, but in the end, we felt that it all generally went well.</p>
