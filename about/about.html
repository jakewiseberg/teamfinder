          <h1>About the Team</h1>
          <p>Team Finder was founded, ironically, in hackMHS's team-making session, after one of its members proposed this website's core idea. 24 hours later, we've produced something far beyond all our expectations, and we've learned many, many new things.</p>

          <div class = "panel-body">
            <h3>Inspiration</h3>
            <p>Our inspiration for this project came from the very event which literally binded the team together: hackMHS's team-bonding event. The team came to a consensus that there was no efficient system of hooking hackers up with each other. We believed that this was especially problematic for new programmers, who, daunted by the giants around them, might feel ostracized and left out (and hence may not come) due to their lack of experience and difficulties in easily finding teams.</p>
            <p>Hence, we came up with the idea to get teams together. Initially we thought of our project as a team <em>generator</em>, but midway we realized that was the wrong approach- to best foster a free open space for novice hackers, it's best to simply introduce them to others like them, and leave them free to disperse. Hence, our final product began to coalesce.</p>

            <h3>Github</h3>
            <p>At the core of this project was Github, a version control system widely used amongst hackers and professional developers all around the country. While we all had some experiences with Github, we became intimately involved with using Github (for lack of a better term) for the first time, whether it be with Sourcetree, Github Desktop, or Git Shell (really it's Git Bash but k). In terms of the learning expereince, Github was undeniably the biggest thing we all learned about today.</p>
            <h3>HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap</h3>
            <p>Obviously, HTML and CSS were core elements of this website, but what was unique about this website for all of us was that it was the first time we used <b>Bootstrap</b>, an API for HTML. Its capabilities exceeded all our imaginations, and gave us plenty new opportunities to modernize our website and exponentially increase our potential.</p>
            <p>While the hardest part about Bootstrap was learning its unique system of classes and its unique structure, the benefit we got back, in terms of the website's appearance and the knowledge we gained, was ten-fold.</p>
            <h3>PHP & SQL</h3>
            <p>PHP and SQL were used to handle the really back-ended aspects of the project. They handled all the raw numbers that we had to process from our form (more about that on this page), and overall kept the page up and running. PHP and SQL were undeniably the <em>hardest</em> portion of this project, but in the end, we felt that it all generally went well.</p>
